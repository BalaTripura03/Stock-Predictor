I'm building a stock prediction web app using **Flask** and an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock data to predict future stock prices. Here’s how I’m implementing it:

1. **Data Collection**: I collect stock data (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume) using APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.

2. **Preprocessing**: I clean and scale the data to prepare it for the model, ensuring it’s ready for training.

3. **LSTM Model**: I use the LSTM model to analyze the time series data and learn patterns in the stock price movements.

4. **Flask Web App**: I built a simple Flask app where users can input stock symbols and view predictions.

5. **Prediction and Visualization**: The app predicts future stock prices and displays them along with visualizations like line charts.

6. **Real-time Updates**: The app can fetch real-time data and update predictions accordingly.

This app integrates machine learning with a web interface, allowing users to easily access stock predictions.
